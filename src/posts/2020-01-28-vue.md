title: 'Oh look, a new site - in VueJS!'

It has been a while since I did anything meaninful with my website. After high school, I just didn't have much use for this site. I still don't!

However, I'm in the process of migrating and consolidating my hosting - which meant revisiting the purpose & design of this site in particular.

This site had been running WordPress for the longest time, and its database was full of.. junk. Old posts that have no meaning, visitor stats that have broken the site's functionality more than once.

After a chat with a friend, I decided - I've been meaning to make something meaningful in VueJS for a while (at work I'm exclusively using React), so why not remake my website. Same design, significantly simpler design. Even better - you can browse both the source & the compiled site on [GitHub](https://github.com/wizardcm/WizardCM.github.io). The structure is all HTML Vue templates, but the pages themselves are originally written in Markdown. Why complicate things, you know?

The only thing really missing is the 'Blog' list, though as I don't post much I'll just leave it exclusively in the footer.

Final job for the core design - a dynamic sidebar. ;)
