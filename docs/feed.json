            "summary": "It has been a while since I did anything meaninful with my website. After high school, I just didn't have much use for this site. I still don't!\nHowever, I'm in the process of migrating and consolidating my hosting - which meant revisiting the purpose &amp; design of this site in particular.\nThis site had been running WordPress for the longest time, and its database was full of.. junk. Old posts that have no meaning, visitor stats that have broken the site's functionality more than once.\nAfter a chat with a friend, I decided - I've been meaning to make something meaningful in VueJS for a while (at work I'm exclusively using React), so why not remake my website. Same design, significantly simpler design. Even better - you can browse both the source &amp; the compiled site on GitHub. The structure is all HTML Vue templates, but the pages themselves are originally written in Markdown. Why complicate things, you know?\nThe only thing really missing is the 'Blog' list, though as I don't post much I'll just leave it exclusively in the footer.\nFinal job for the core design - a dynamic sidebar. üòâ",

            "summary": "The title of this post is a sentence that has crossed my mind and my lips a few times in the past couple of years. Until this week, I didn‚Äôt understand how accurate I was.\nMost people can think of something, say, an apple, and visually imagine it in their mind. They can manipulate how it looks, where it is and what it‚Äôs doing. Until this week, I thought ‚Äúvisually‚Äù meant metaphorically. Theoretically. But no, when people say visually, they actually mean visually.\nThe lack of the ability to see in that way? The inability to use ‚Äúthe mind‚Äôs eye‚Äù? That‚Äôs called Aphantasia. And I have it.",
